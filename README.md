# Smart-City-AI-Multimodal-Analysis-of-Urban-Issue-Reports
This project will explore how AI can support smart-city management by analyzing citizen reports about urban issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, or waste problems. Each report includes text, images, and geolocation data, which are processed and combined to automatically classify the type of issue, estimate its urgency, and uncover spatial or temporal patterns that can help city administrators prioritize interventions.
